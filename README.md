# CTC Traders - Technical Interface Specification

## Getting started

To preview or build the website, we need to use the terminal.

Install Ruby 3.0.x with Rubygems, perferably with a [Ruby version manager][rvm],
and the [Bundler gem][bundler].

In the application folder type the following to install the required gems:

```
bundle install
```

## Making changes

To make changes edit the source files in the `source` folder.

### Single page output

Although a single page of HTML is generated the markdown is spread across
multiple files to make it easier to manage. They can be found in
`source/documentation`.

A new markdown file isn't automatically included in the generated output. If we
add a new markdown file at the location `source/documentation/agile/scrum.md`,
the following snippet in `source/index.html.md.erb`, includes it in the
generated output.

```
<%= partial 'documentation/agile/scrum' %>
```

Including files manually like this lets us specify the position they appear in
the page.

### Multiple pages

To add a completely new page, create a file with a `.html.md` extension in the `/source` directory.

For example, `source/about.html.md` will be accessible on <http://localhost:4567/about.html>.

## Previewing

#### Option 1 - Using Docker (recommended)

Requirements:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

To live preview:
```
./batect preview
```
The local URL and port where the files can be previewed will be output, this is normally http://localhost:4567.

NB The first time this is run it builds the Docker image and installs dependencies so may take 5 mins.
Subsequent runs will be much quicker.

#### Option 2 - Local install (Not recommended)

Requirements:
* [Ruby Version Manager][rbenv]
* [Node Version Manager][nodenv]

To live preview:
```
bundle install
bundle exec middleman serve
```
The local URL and port where the files can be previewed will be output, this is normally http://localhost:4567.

## Running the Scala Application

Requirements:
* Scala/sbt

### Build the HTML files
```
./batect build
```
### Run the Scala Application
```
sbt run
```

The local URL and port where the files can be previewed will be output, this is normally http://localhost:9000.

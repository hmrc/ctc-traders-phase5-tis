## Message details

Message type details are as follows: 

- characteristics of the data groups belonging to a message: sequence, number of repetitions, and a status value to indicate if a data group is one of the folllowing: 
    - mandatory ('R': Required)
    - optional ('O': Optional) 
    - conditional ('D': Dependent)
    - do not use ('N': Not Usable)
- characteristics of the data items belonging to a data group: sequence, number of repetitions, type, length, and a value to indicate if a data item is one of the folllowing: 
    - mandatory ('R': Required) 
    - optional ('O': Optional)
    - conditional ('D': Dependent)
- data group nesting is shown with dashes, which means that a data group may contain not only data items but also other groups of data. 
- links to applicable NCTS code lists:
    - each link downloads a zip file from a European Commission [website](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/rd/rd_download_home.jsp?Lang=en)
    - the code lists are updated regularly
    - consider setting up an automated way to download the files regularly and integrate them with your software
- links to applicable rules and conditions 
- header elements (XML fields that can contain other XML fields) are highlighted in **bold**

**Note:** If you use a data group with priority 'N' in a message, NCTS will reject the message. 

## Message categorisation by sender

Some message types are sent by the NCTS while other message types are sent by traders.

**Note:** The 'Status' column in each table indicates whether a message type is new in NCTS5, or new to the United Kingdom (UK) in NCTS5, or upgraded from NCTS4 to NCTS5.

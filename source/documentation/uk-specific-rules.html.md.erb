# UK Specific Rules

To clarify UK specific processes and track temporary measures it was suggested by a
software developer that we record changes in the same format as transit specification Rules
and Conditions. We have adopted this approach, and will add, edit, or remove these rules as
required moving forward, with confirmation of changes spotlit in Tech Clinics and the
changelog.


The rules will be listed separately for GB (Great Britain) and XI (Northern Ireland) to ensure
clarity where there are differences due to policy, system, or geographical reasons.


If you have questions or concerns about these rules, or suggestions for improvement, please
let us know via raising tickets (SDST), at tech clinic, or by contacting our team:
transit.customspolicy@hmrc.gov.uk

## GB001

Transit movements involving goods which are being **exported** from GB or XI must be
associated with an Export Declaration MRN made to **CDS - Customs Declaration Service.**

This **Export Declaration MRN** should be referenced in the Transit Declaration at the most
appropriate declaration level: Consignment, House Consignment, or Consignment Item, in
either the **'Previous Document'** or **'Supporting Document'** data groups.

If using the Previous Document data group, the **Type** data element derived from **CL214**
(Previous Document Type) should be **NMRN** - Declaration/Notification MRN, or an
established alternative which does not confuse the nature of the previous document in
countries of destination.

If using the Supporting Document data group, the **Type** data element derived from **CL213**
(Supporting Document Type) should be **NZZZ** - Document equivalent to ‘ZZZ’ defined in
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/341 (Appendix D2: Additional codes for the
computerised transit system).

Use of these codes is part of a workaround to bypass the actual export declaration MRN
reference **N830** (Goods declaration for exportation) which, due to overlap with specific AES
(Automated Export System) functionality, cannot currently be used for goods exported from
the UK moving via transit without restricting the Office of Destination able to be declared to
only those which double as an EU **Office of Exit** (a customs office at the border of the EU
which handles EU Export Declarations).

If your intended Office of Destination for the transit procedure, is, an office of exit - Previous
Document reference N830 may be used without issue at the House Consignment level of
the declaration.

When AES functionality is established in XI - N830 may be used for transit movements
containing EU export goods departing from an XI (Northern Ireland) Office of Departure and
will be necessary to ensure proper interaction between NCTS and AES on outbound EU
export goods.

## GB002

From TPendDate for NCTS phase 6: **01/09/2025**, Transit Declaration IE015 **Security-Type**
cannot include ENS data.

Data group - **Transit Operation**, data element -- **Security**, values from CL217 (Declaration
Type Security) should be restricted to only values 0 (not used for safety and security
purposes) and 2 (EXS - Exit Summary Declaration data).
Values 1 (ENS - Entry Summary Declaration data) and 3 (Combined EXS &amp; ENS) include ENS
data and are no longer allowable as they may confound the correct processes for **NCTS 6
opt-in** countries receiving declarations containing these values.

This is a temporary measure - the options will be removed from the codelist (or a new
codelist used instead) as we approach NCTS 6 operations in the future. There will be a rule
validation in place shortly after 01/09/2025 to reject IE015s which do not consider the
above and are submitted with Security Type 1 or 3, more information will follow.
